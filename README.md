# Mixed Messages: A Random Message Generator
## Project Overview
This project is a simple message generator program built as part of the Codecademy "Back-End Engineer" Career Path. The program generates a random, multi-part message every time it is run. This version is themed around providing a small piece of randomized motivation for fellow programmers.

The project exists in two forms:
1. A console-based script that runs with Node.js.
2. A simple web page that displays the message and allows the user to generate a new one with a button click.

## Features
+ Randomized Output: Each message is constructed from three different parts, ensuring a unique and random output every time.
+ Two Versions: Can be run either directly in the console using Node.js or viewed in a web browser.
+ Interactive Web Interface: The web version includes a button to generate a new message on demand.

## Technologies Used
+ **JavaScript (ES6)**: Core logic for message generation.
+ **HTML5**: Structure for the web page version.
+ **CSS3**: Styling for a clean and pleasant user interface.
